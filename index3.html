   <h4><b>The Best Ways to Commit Arson</b></h4>
   <p>We learned that it is best to start two fires on opposite ends of the house. They will spread quickly, <br>outsmarting the smoke alarms and out running the fire department.</p>
   <h5><b>First things first we need to</b></h5>
   <ol>
    <li>Unroll paper towels [Do not tear]</li>
    <li>Place the end in the toaster on the counter</li>
    <li>Drape slack around the kitchen</li>
    <li>Make toast</li>
    <li>Locate the linen closet</li>
    <li>Light a cigarette</li>
    <li>Place the lit cigarette into the match book</li>
    <li>Throw the match book into the closet [Preferably next to a synthetic pillow]</li>
   </ol>
   <p>The cigarette provides a time delay | Walk out and don't look guilty | Don't feel guilty.</p>
   <p>We must start over. We will return after investigation; after they cannot track the fire back to us. <br>We will gather up the ashes and watch water carry them into the storm drain. <br>We will find a new lot and we will begin with new linens and cushions and a shiny new dining room table. In new light</p>
